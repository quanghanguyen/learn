Define the problem you’re trying to solve 

Make sure you fully understand the stakeholder’s expectations

Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions

Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication

Take a step back and see the whole situation in context

----------

What are my stakeholders saying their problems are?

Now that I’ve identified the issues, how can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?
